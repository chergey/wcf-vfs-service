# Lightweight Virtual File System implementation

- To build project you need [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/whatsnew/)

## What is used
- C# 7 (pattern matching, tuples)
- AOP logging (NConern and CNepture libs)
- WCF 
- MSTest


## Description
- Client - console client via ChannelFactory<T>
- Service - WCF-service
- WinService - windows service
- Ð¡onsoleHost - console host
- Tests - Vfs storage tests

## API
- Vfs operations are performed in Root directory (default = c:), e.g., Root.DeleteFile("directory\subdirectory\file1.txt"). With this approach, however, we don't remmember full path when throwing expceptions
- Can also find neeed directory using FindEntity, then call appropriate method (e.g. dir=FindEntity("directory\subdirectory"); dir.DeleteFile("file1.txt"))


## Found bugs
- Debugging does not work correctly (Step Into, member variables don't show in Locals and Autos windows) when adding CNeptune to references (which is necessary to make project work with NConcern) - [bug is hiding in Mono.Cecil](https://github.com/Virtuoze/CNeptune/issues/11)

## Misc
- VfsFile has a public constructor (which is bad), can be remedied by making VfsDirectory implemening IVfsFile but then will have to store type of entity a a file in VfsEntity
